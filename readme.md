# Purpose
This is repo is used to parctise rl code based on spiningup repo.
By typing each line of code for all SOTA algorithm so that we can 
better understand both the theory and the  implementation tricks.


# Plans
- first round: write codes by referring to the original code, focus on 
understand the logic of the codes
- second round: write code by own hand, may partial refer to the original 
codes
- third round: no reference, implement code with your own ideas
